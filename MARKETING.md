# Trace - Marketing Guide

**Tagline:** Every trade, tracked automatically

---

## Brand Identity

### Name & Positioning
**Trace** — Because every transaction leaves a trail, and we follow it to the penny.

**Core Promise:** Forensic-level tracking that turns your chaotic trading history into clean, accountant-ready tax reports.

**Target Audience:**
- Solana degen traders (memecoin flippers, NFT traders)
- Crypto freelancers receiving payments on-chain
- DeFi yield farmers with complex transaction histories
- Anyone who's made 100+ trades and dreads tax season

### Brand Personality
- **Precise:** We catch every swap, every transfer, every dust transaction
- **Intelligent:** Automated categorization, smart gain/loss calculations
- **Calm:** Takes the stress out of tax chaos
- **Technical:** Built for the complexity of on-chain trading
- **Trustworthy:** Your accountant will approve

## Visual Identity

### Color Palette
```
Primary:   #6366F1 (Indigo-500)  — Intelligent, technical, analytical
Secondary: #0F172A (Slate-900)   — Professional, serious, trustworthy
Accent:    #10B981 (Emerald-500) — Positive gains, success
Error:     #EF4444 (Red-500)     — Losses, warnings
Muted:     #F8FAFC (Slate-50)    — Backgrounds, subtle elements
Text:      #1E293B (Slate-800)   — Primary text
```

### Typography
- **Headings:** Inter Bold / Satoshi Bold
- **Body:** Inter Regular
- **Data/Numbers:** JetBrains Mono (monospace for transaction IDs, addresses)
- **Tone:** Clean, modern, technical but not intimidating

### Logo Concept
**Primary:** Geometric "TRACE" wordmark with a subtle line-graph forming the T crossbar, suggesting transaction flow.

**Icon:** Abstract network nodes connected by traced lines (like following a path), or a simplified timeline with dots representing transactions.

**Style:** Minimal, geometric, slightly technical. Think Stripe's level of sophistication.

## Messaging Framework

### Value Propositions

**Primary (Hero):**
"Paste your wallet. Get your tax report. In seconds."

**Supporting Messages:**
- "Every trade tracked automatically — from moonshots to rugpulls"
- "Turn 10,000 transactions into one clean PDF"
- "Your accountant will actually understand your crypto gains"
- "No manual CSV uploads. No missed transactions. No stress."

### Problem → Solution

| Trader's Pain | How Trace Solves It |
|---------------|---------------------|
| "I made 1000+ trades, how do I even start?" | Automatic wallet scan pulls every transaction |
| "I used 5 different wallets across DEXs" | Multi-wallet aggregation in one report |
| "I don't know which trades were taxable" | Smart categorization: trades vs. transfers vs. fees |
| "My accountant doesn't understand crypto" | Standard PDF/CSV format they already use |
| "I'm scared I'll get audited" | Detailed transaction log with timestamps & hashes |

### Taglines by Use Case

**For Memecoin Traders:**
"From degen to documented in 60 seconds"

**For DeFi Users:**
"Trace every yield, swap, and stake — automatically"

**For Tax Procrastinators:**
"It's April 14th. We've got you covered."

## Social Media Playbook

### Twitter/X Strategy

**Content Pillars:**
1. **Education (40%):** Tax tips, how-to threads, myth-busting
2. **Product (30%):** Feature demos, updates, success stories
3. **Community (20%):** Memes, polls, engagement
4. **Thought Leadership (10%):** Crypto tax policy, regulation news

**Sample Tweets:**

**Educational:**
```
Most Solana traders don't know:

Swapping $BONK for $WIF is a taxable event.

Even if you never cashed out to USD.

Here's what you actually owe 🧵
```

**Product:**
```
New: Trace now auto-detects Jupiter limit orders

Your stop-losses are tracked.
Your DCA buys are tracked.
Your late-night ape-ins are tracked.

Every. Single. Trade.

Try it → [link]
```

**Community:**
```
POV: It's April 14th and you just remembered you made 347 trades this year

[gif of panicking trader]

Good thing Trace takes 60 seconds → [link]
```

**Thought Leadership:**
```
The IRS just updated crypto guidance.

What it means for Solana traders:
- Staking rewards taxed as income (not capital gains)
- NFT royalties = income
- Airdrops = income at receipt

Translation: You probably owe more than you think.
```

### Engagement Tactics
- **Reply game:** Answer every tax question in r/solana, Solana Discord
- **Polls:** "How many trades did you make in 2024?" (lead gen)
- **AMAs:** Partner with Solana projects for tax Q&A
- **Giveaways:** "RT + tag a degen who needs this = free Pro plan"

## Final Thoughts

**Trace** is not just a tax tool — it's peace of mind for traders who live on-chain.

Every aspect of this brand should reinforce:
1. **Precision:** We don't miss a single transaction
2. **Simplicity:** Wallet in, report out, done
3. **Trust:** Accountants approve, IRS accepts, you sleep well

The Solana ecosystem is full of builders and degens who need this. Our job is to meet them where they are (Twitter, Discord, wallets) and make tax season the easiest part of their year.

**Next Steps:**
1. Build MVP: Wallet scan → PDF report (core loop)
2. Test with 50 real wallets (friends, small CT influencers)
3. Launch during tax season (Feb 1) for maximum urgency
4. Iterate based on feedback, add CSV export, multi-wallet
5. Scale with partnerships (Phantom, Jupiter) and paid ads
